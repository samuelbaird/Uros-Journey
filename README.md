 # PROJECT 1 - URO'S JOURNEY
 ---

## Technical Requirements
Your App Must:

☐ Render a game in the browser.

☐ Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. Popup alerts using the alert() method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Use vanilla JavaScript, not jQuery.

☐ Have properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining unused and/or commented out code (code that will never be called) .

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.

☐ Be coded in a consistent manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!
